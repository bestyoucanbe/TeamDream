# TeamDream

# Want to create your Dream Team?  Use Team Dream!

As long as I have been here at the Nashville Software School, we have been practicing doing retrospectives after our sprints.  It does have its benefits.  I would like to take this one step further and empower individuals to take it to the next level by creating a personal development plan to implement at their own volition using the Team Dream application.  This personal development plan involves reflecting on the recently completed sprint and retrospective to select items that he/she would like to pursue further personally and adding any related items to this list as they see fit.  These items will then be added as Action Items to pursue to completion or reflect upon as appropriate.  This application was designed with the idea that it can be highly customized to each individual's situation and priorities.  Some example Action Types that I have repeatedly used in the recent past are shown below:

1.  Things I need to START doing
2.  Things I need to STOP doing
3.  Things I need to CONTINUE doing

By tracking each of these items at a personal level, it is hoped that the individual improves his/her performance from sprint to sprint and has a model for success going forward.

Clicking on the 'Home Menu' after registering/logging in, you will see the steps to start using this Application.

Wish you the best success!

Sincerely,

Joy Ittycheriah
